I used the meteoritic solar abundances shown in Table 1 of Asplund et al. (2009) for all single ionized species.

To obtain sensible typical ratios of AlIII/AlII and SiIV/SiII I used
the ionic column densities of the DLAs from Jason Prochaska's online
DLA abundance database from HIRES spectroscopy:
http://www.ucolick.org/~xavier/DLA/Kingpin . For each ratio, I found
the median logarithmic column density difference from the sample of
absorbers which contained both species. In particular, I used the
following transitions only when searching for ionic column density
measurements and get the following median ratios:

AlIII1854/AlII1670: -0.581. Adopt -0.60
SiIV1393/SiII1526 : -0.959. Adopt -1.00

For a sensible typical ratio of MgI/MgII I used the ionic column
densities in individual clouds from the multi-cloud absorption systems
in Churchill & Vogt (2001, ApJ, 122, 679). A typical logarithmic
column density difference from their Table 7 is MgI/MgII = -1.79. I
adopt -1.80.
